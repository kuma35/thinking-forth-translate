     *It is impossible to disassociate language
     from science or science from language, because every natural science
     always involves three things: the sequence of phenomena on which the
     science is based, the abstract concepts which call these phenomena
     to mind, and the words in which the concepts are expressed. To call
     forth a concept, a word is needed; to portray a phenomenon, a
     concept is needed. All three mirror one and the same reality.*

     \-\-\- Antoine Lavoisier, 1789
