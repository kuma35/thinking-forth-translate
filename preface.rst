Programming computers can be crazy-making. Other
professions give you the luxury of seeing tangible proof of your
efforts. A watchmaker can watch the cogs and wheels; a seamstress can
watch the seams come together with each stitch. But programmers design,
build, and repair the stuff of imagination, ghostly mechanisms that
escape the senses. Our work takes place not in RAM, not in an editor,
but within our own minds.

Building models in the mind is both the challenge and the joy of
programming. How should we prepare for it? Arm ourselves with better
debuggers, decompilers, and disassemblers? They help, but our most
essential tools and techniques are mental. We need a consistent and
practical methodology for *thinking about* software problems. That is
what I have tried to capture in this book. *Thinking Forth* is meant for
anyone interested in writing software to solve problems. It focuses on
design and implementation; deciding what you want to accomplish,
designing the components of the system, and finally building the
program.

The book stresses the importance of writing programs that not only work,
but that are also readable, logical, and that express the best solution
in the simplest terms.

Although most of the principles described here can be applied to any
language, I’ve presented them in the context of Forth. Forth is a
language, an operating system, a set of tools, and a philosophy. It is
an ideal means for thinking because it corresponds to the way our minds
work. *Thinking Forth* is thinking simple, thinking elegant, thinking
flexible. It is *not* restrictive, *not* complicated, *not*
over-general. You don’t have to know Forth to benefit from this book.
*Thinking Forth* synthesizes the Forth approach with many principles
taught by modern computer science. The marriage of Forth\’s simplicity
with the traditional disciplines of analysis and style will give you a
new and better way to look at software problems and will be helpful in
all areas of computer application.

If you want to learn more about Forth, another book of mine,
*Starting Forth*, covers the language aspects of Forth. Otherwise,
Appendix A of this book introduces Forth fundamentals.

A few words about the layout of the book: After devoting the first
chapter to fundamental concepts, I\’ve patterned the book after the
software development cycle; from initial specification up through
implementation. The appendixes in back include an overview of Forth for
those new to the language, code for several of the utilities described,
answers to problems, and a summary of style conventions.

Many of the ideas in this book are unscientific. They are based on
subjective experience and observations of our own humanity. For this
reason, I\’ve included interviews with a variety of Forth professionals,
not all of whom completely agree with one another, or with me. All these
opinions are subject to change without notice. The book also offers
suggestions called “tips”. They are meant to be taken only as they apply
to your situation. Forth thinking accepts no inviolable rules. To ensure
the widest possible conformity to available Forth systems, all coded
examples in this book are consistent with the Forth-83 Standard.

One individual who greatly influenced this book is the man who invented
Forth, Charles Moore. In addition to spending several days interviewing
him for this book, I\’ve been privileged to watch him at work. He is a
master craftsman, moving with speed and deftness, as though he were
physically altering the conceptual models inside the machine—building,
tinkering, playing. He accomplishes this with a minimum of tools (the
result of an ongoing battle against insidious complexity) and few
restrictions other than those imposed by his own techniques. I hope this
book captures some of his wisdom. Enjoy!

Many thanks to all the good people who gave their time and ideas to this
book, including: Charles Moore, Dr. Mark Bernstein,
Dave Johnson, John Teleska, Dr. Michael Starling,
Dr. Peter Kogge, Tom Dowling, Donald Burgess,
Cary Campbell, Dr. Raymond Dessy, Michael Ham, and
Kim Harris. Another of the interviewees, Michael LaManna,
passed away while this book was in production.
He is deeply missed by those of us who loved him.
