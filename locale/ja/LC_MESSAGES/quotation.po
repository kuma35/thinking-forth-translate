"*It is impossible to disassociate language from science or science from "
"language, because every natural science always involves three things: the"
" sequence of phenomena on which the science is based, the abstract "
"concepts which call these phenomena to mind, and the words in which the "
"concepts are expressed. To call forth a concept, a word is needed; to "
"portray a phenomenon, a concept is needed. All three mirror one and the "
"same reality.*"
