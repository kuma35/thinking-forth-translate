Preface to the 1994 Edition
***************************

I\’m honored that the Forth Interest Group is
reprinting *Thinking Forth.* It\’s gratifying to know that the book may
have value to appreciators and users of Forth.

This edition is a reproduction of the original edition, with only minor
typographical corrections. A lot has happened in the ten years since the
book’s original publication, rendering some of the opinions obsolete, or
at best archaic. A “revised, updated edition” would have entrailed a
rewrite of many sections, a larger effort than I\’m able to make at the
time.

Off all the opinions in the book, the one that I most regret seeing in
print is my criticism of object-oriented programming. Since penning this
book, I\’ve had the pleasure of writing an application in a version of
Forth with support for object-oriented programming, developed by Digalog
Corp. of Ventura, California. I\’m no expert, but it\’s clear that the
methodology has much to offer.

With all this, I believe that many of the ideas in *Thinking Forth* are
as valid today as they were back then. Certainly
Charles
Moore’s comments remain a telling insight on the philosophy that
triggered the development of Forth.

I wish to thank Marlin Ouverson for his excellent job, patiently
struggling against incompatible file formats and OCR errors, to bring
this reprint to life.
