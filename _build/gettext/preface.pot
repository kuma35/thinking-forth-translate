msgid "Programming computers can be crazy-making. Other professions give you the luxury of seeing tangible proof of your efforts. A watchmaker can watch the cogs and wheels; a seamstress can watch the seams come together with each stitch. But programmers design, build, and repair the stuff of imagination, ghostly mechanisms that escape the senses. Our work takes place not in RAM, not in an editor, but within our own minds."

msgid "Building models in the mind is both the challenge and the joy of programming. How should we prepare for it? Arm ourselves with better debuggers, decompilers, and disassemblers? They help, but our most essential tools and techniques are mental. We need a consistent and practical methodology for *thinking about* software problems. That is what I have tried to capture in this book. *Thinking Forth* is meant for anyone interested in writing software to solve problems. It focuses on design and implementation; deciding what you want to accomplish, designing the components of the system, and finally building the program."

msgid "The book stresses the importance of writing programs that not only work, but that are also readable, logical, and that express the best solution in the simplest terms."

msgid "Although most of the principles described here can be applied to any language, I’ve presented them in the context of Forth. Forth is a language, an operating system, a set of tools, and a philosophy. It is an ideal means for thinking because it corresponds to the way our minds work. *Thinking Forth* is thinking simple, thinking elegant, thinking flexible. It is *not* restrictive, *not* complicated, *not* over-general. You don’t have to know Forth to benefit from this book. *Thinking Forth* synthesizes the Forth approach with many principles taught by modern computer science. The marriage of Forth\\’s simplicity with the traditional disciplines of analysis and style will give you a new and better way to look at software problems and will be helpful in all areas of computer application."

msgid "If you want to learn more about Forth, another book of mine, *Starting Forth*, covers the language aspects of Forth. Otherwise, :doc:`Appendix A<appendixa>` of this book introduces Forth fundamentals."

msgid "A few words about the layout of the book: After devoting the first chapter to fundamental concepts, I\\’ve patterned the book after the software development cycle; from initial specification up through implementation. The appendixes in back include an overview of Forth for those new to the language, code for several of the utilities described, answers to problems, and a summary of style conventions."

msgid "Many of the ideas in this book are unscientific. They are based on subjective experience and observations of our own humanity. For this reason, I\\’ve included interviews with a variety of Forth professionals, not all of whom completely agree with one another, or with me. All these opinions are subject to change without notice. The book also offers suggestions called “tips”. They are meant to be taken only as they apply to your situation. Forth thinking accepts no inviolable rules. To ensure the widest possible conformity to available Forth systems, all coded examples in this book are consistent with the Forth-83 Standard."

msgid "One individual who greatly influenced this book is the man who invented Forth, Charles Moore. In addition to spending several days interviewing him for this book, I\\’ve been privileged to watch him at work. He is a master craftsman, moving with speed and deftness, as though he were physically altering the conceptual models inside the machine—building, tinkering, playing. He accomplishes this with a minimum of tools (the result of an ongoing battle against insidious complexity) and few restrictions other than those imposed by his own techniques. I hope this book captures some of his wisdom. Enjoy!"

msgid "Many thanks to all the good people who gave their time and ideas to this book, including: Charles Moore, Dr. Mark Bernstein, Dave Johnson, John Teleska, Dr. Michael Starling, Dr. Peter Kogge, Tom Dowling, Donald Burgess, Cary Campbell, Dr. Raymond Dessy, Michael Ham, and Kim Harris. Another of the interviewees, Michael LaManna, passed away while this book was in production. He is deeply missed by those of us who loved him."
