msgid "This edition is a reproduction of the original edition, with only minor typographical corrections. A lot has happened in the ten years since the book’s original publication, rendering some of the opinions obsolete, or at best archaic. A “revised, updated edition” would have entrailed a rewrite of many sections, a larger effort than I\\’m able to make at the time."

msgid "Off all the opinions in the book, the one that I most regret seeing in print is my criticism of object-oriented programming. Since penning this book, I\\’ve had the pleasure of writing an application in a version of Forth with support for object-oriented programming, developed by Digalog Corp. of Ventura, California. I\\’m no expert, but it\\’s clear that the methodology has much to offer."

msgid "With all this, I believe that many of the ideas in *Thinking Forth* are as valid today as they were back then. Certainly Charles Moore’s comments remain a telling insight on the philosophy that triggered the development of Forth."
